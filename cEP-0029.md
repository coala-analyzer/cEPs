## Abstract

This document describes how support for TOML will be implemented and integrated
with the existing configuration system. It also describes how other features
that complement the base idea will be implemented as part of this
[GSoC project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6388671438127104).

## Introduction

Having a configuration file is essential to make full use of coala.
Having a standardized configuration format like TOML helps.
coala currently has an INI style configuration. INI style configurations
has certain limitations when it comes to custom sub-level parsing.
The LineParser and ConfParser becomes complex and error-prone.
A standardized configuration format allows developers to quickly
implement new features and will allow users to write configuration files
in a format that they are probably more familiar with.

This project is a step towards making coala easier to use. As a part
of this project a repository of good configuration files will be
created that will allow users to quickly bootstrap their projects.


## TOML syntax for coala configuration


### Basic TOML concepts
- The basic building blocks of toml are `key-value` pairs.
- Values can be integers, booleans, arrays, floats,
  date and time
- A collection of key-value pairs form a `table`.
  A table can be used to group rules into a section.
- Array of tables can be used to list `collections`.
eg:- collection of friends with their attributes

### coala configuration concepts
From the perspective of coala, only `tables` are of importance.
Configuration concepts currently in use in coala:
- Section as a collection of settings (key-value pairs)
- Concept of inheritance in sections
- Aspects and tastes

Keeping the TOML concepts and coala configuration concepts
in mind, TOML syntax for coala has been decided.

- Settings shall be declared as key-value pairs
- Sections shall be declared as tables
- Inheritance shall be supported through the use of
a key called `inherits`. Appending of an inherited setting
shall be through a key called `append`.
- Aspects from a section shall be declared in the form of
  `[section_name.aspect_name]`


### Aspects or settings as a group of settings
The syntax [all.python] cannot be used to depict inheritance
in toml as in coafile. This is because TOML parsers consider
`python` to be a setting in the section `all`.
This type of syntax is more suitable when a setting itself
is defined by a group of settings within a section.
```toml
[all]
a.b = 10
a.c = 20
a.d = 30
b = 45
```
can also be represented as

```toml
[all]
b = 10

[all.a]
b = 10
c = 20
d = 30
```

Since aspects are settings within a section and since aspects
have their own group of settings, this syntax perfectly suits
aspects.

Aspects in coafile
```text
[all]
files = **
aspects = aspectname1, AspectName2 # case-insensitive
# defining an aspect's taste
aspectname1:aspect_taste = 80
# we can define subaspect taste through its parent
aspectname1:subaspect_taste = word1, word2, word3
```

is equivalent to

```toml
[all]
files = '**'
aspects = ['aspectname1', 'AspectName2'] # case-insensitive

[all.aspectname1]
aspect_taste = 80
subaspect_taste = ['word1', 'word2', 'word3']
```

or

```toml
[all]
files = '**'
aspects = ['aspectname1', 'AspectName2'] # case-insensitive
aspectname1.aspect_taste = 80
AspectName2.subaspect_taste = ['word1', 'word2', 'word3']
```
in TOML.

### Inheritance

Inheritance in coafile
```text
[all]
enabled = True
overridable = 2
ignore = vendor1/

[all.section1]
overridable = 3
ignore += vendor2/
other = some_value
```

is equivalent to

```toml
[all]
enabled = true
overridable = 2
ignore = 'vendor1/'

[section1]
inherits = 'all'
appends = 'ignore'
overrideable = 3
ignore = 'value2/'
other = 'some_value'
```

in TOML


### Trying to have syntax like coafile
If inheritance were to represented as `[all.python]` as in coafile,
then there would be no way to represent aspects or setting as a group
of settings in TOML. This would also confuse users of TOML.


## Implementation

The implementation shall consist of following parts

- Infrastructure to load the toml configuration files
- Implementation of TomlConfParser
- Implementation of TomlConfWriter
- Tool to convert .coafile to TOML config file.
- Support coala-quickstart to generate config files in TOML.
- Develop TOMLLintBear
- A repository of good config files to allow users to easily
bootstrap their projects.


### Infrastructure to load the toml configuration files

Before toml files can be used to configure coala, a mechanism
must exist to load them. The loaded file can then be passed
into `toml.load`. For this a new configuration flag
called `coala -T` shall be created. This will enable coala to
run on toml config files. Also creating such a flag is highly
beneficial. This way the flags -c , -F, -I and -s can also be
used with respect to toml.

To achieve this, I will refactor the `load_configuration` function.
I will not change the nature or number of function parameters
and return values. This way the behaviour of the function shall
remain the same. If `coala -T` is will call a function that
will provide toml sections and targets else it will provide normal
sections and targets. A function called `load_toml_config_file`
equivalent to `load_config_file` will be created.


### Implementation of TomlConfParser

The goal of this part is to get the OrderedDict from `toml.load`
and convert it into sections. For each table, the individual
key-value pairs have to converted to Settings. Finally these
settings have to grouped into a section. The concepts of
aspects and inheritance has to be accounted for. It's
function is similar to the present `ConfParser`.

This enables coala to run on configurations written in TOML
file.

It should convert

```python
OrderedDict([('Default',
              OrderedDict([('files',
                            ['*.py',
                             'coalib/**/*.py',
                             './coala',
                             'tests/**/*.py',
                             'docs/conf.py']),
                           ('ignore',
                            ['tests/bearlib/languages/documentation/documentation_extraction_testdata/*.py',
                             'tests/collecting/collectors_test_dir/bears/incorrect_bear.py',
                             'coalib/misc/Asyncio.py']),
                           ('max_line_length', 80),
                           ('use_spaces', True)]))])
```
into

```python
OrderedDict([('default',
              <Section object(aspects=None,
              contents=OrderedDict([('files', <Setting object(key='files', value='*.py, coalib/**/*.py, ./coala, tests/**/*.py, docs/conf.py', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cd780>),
              ('ignore', <Setting object(key='ignore', value='tests/bearlib/languages/documentation/documentation_extraction_testdata/*.py,\ntests/collecting/collectors_test_dir/bears/incorrect_bear.py,\ncoalib/misc/Asyncio.py,',
              origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cdbe0>),
              ('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cdb70>),
              ('max_line_length', <Setting object(key='max_line_length', value='80', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cda20>),
              ('use_spaces', <Setting object(key='use_spaces', value='True', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cd898>)]), defaults=None,
              language=None, name='Default') at 0x108bdf550>)])
```


### Implementation of TomlConfWriter

The TomlConfWriter receives sections and it has to convert it into a OrderedDict
for `toml.dump`. This writes the sections to a TOML config file. It has a function
that is opposite to the TomlConfParser. It's
function is similar to the present `ConfWriter`.

This will enable users to use --save in TOML. It will also allow coala-quickstart
to generate TOML config files.

It should convert

```python
OrderedDict([('default',
              <Section object(aspects=None,
              contents=OrderedDict([('files', <Setting object(key='files', value='*.py, coalib/**/*.py, ./coala, tests/**/*.py, docs/conf.py', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cd780>),
              ('ignore', <Setting object(key='ignore', value='tests/bearlib/languages/documentation/documentation_extraction_testdata/*.py,\ntests/collecting/collectors_test_dir/bears/incorrect_bear.py,\ncoalib/misc/Asyncio.py,',
              origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cdbe0>),
              ('comment0', <Setting object(key='comment0', value='', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cdb70>),
              ('max_line_length', <Setting object(key='max_line_length', value='80', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cda20>),
              ('use_spaces', <Setting object(key='use_spaces', value='True', origin='/Users/userx/Documents/coala/coala/.coafile', from_cli=False, to_append=False) at 0x1092cd898>)]), defaults=None,
              language=None, name='Default') at 0x108bdf550>)])
```

into

```python
OrderedDict([('Default',
              OrderedDict([('files',
                            ['*.py',
                             'coalib/**/*.py',
                             './coala',
                             'tests/**/*.py',
                             'docs/conf.py']),
                           ('ignore',
                            ['tests/bearlib/languages/documentation/documentation_extraction_testdata/*.py',
                             'tests/collecting/collectors_test_dir/bears/incorrect_bear.py',
                             'coalib/misc/Asyncio.py']),
                           ('max_line_length', 80),
                           ('use_spaces', True)]))])
```
into


### Tool to convert .coafile to TOML config file

A new flag will be created to allow .coafile to
be converted to TOML config files and vice versa.

```bash
$ coala --create-toml .coafile
$ coala --create-coafile .coafile.toml
```

The loaded sections from either .coafile or .coafile.toml
can be supplied to:
- TomlConfWriter to create TOML config file
- ConfWriter to create coafile


### Support coala-quickstart to generate config files in TOML.

coala-quickstart will be made to generate config files in TOML.
A new option -T that will allow config files to be created in
TOML.

New functions `write_toml_config` and `write_toml_info` will
be created which will perform the functions similar to existing
`write_coafile` and `write_info` functions but with respect to TOML.

Regarding green mode, I will create `write_toml_sections` function
similar to `write_sections` for TOML. Also the function
`generate_green_mode_sections` will be modified to accommodate
for TOML config file.


### Develop TOMLLintBear

coala-bears currently has bear for TOML called `TOMLBear.py` which
uses a external linter. But it requires Go to be installed.
So this bear can mainly be used only by Go users.

The task is to create `TOMLLintBear` in python. This way it can
be used by all users without any additional language requirements
as python comes installed in most computers.

The bear shall catch syntax errors in a TOML file. This shall be
done in 2 passes.
- In the first pass, the TOML file shall be validated per character
- In the second pass, the TOML file shall be validated per line

This approach is similar to the toml library. As part of this project
the bear shall be a validator and only check the validity of the TOML
file. In the future when style guidelines are created formatting
capability can be added.


### A repository of good config files to allow users to easily bootstrap their projects.

This part aims to start a project which contains a repository of known
and good coafile configurations. This will help users to quickly bootstrap
their projects. A minimal version of this project shall be implemented here.
