## Abstract

This cEP describes the upgrades and steps required to enable coala
to support newer versions of Python. This project has been taken up
as a [GSoC'21][1] project.

## Introduction

Lack of support for newer versions of Python has been a significant
hurdle in the development of coala. coala, as of now, supports
Python up to version 3.6, which is  quite old. Version 3.6 was
released back in 2016, and Python has made considerable progress
since then. coala, on the other hand, has largely not been able to
benefit from these upgrades because of the strict version limitations.
Upgrading coala to support newer versions will accelerate the
development of coala and will make it future proof.

## Objectives

The project's primary goal is to enable coala to support newer
Python versions and attain this in multiple smaller steps.
The goal is not just to facilitate support for newer versions
of Python but also to upgrade the coala to support more recent
dependencies. Upgrades will be performed over multiple 
repositories as the dependencies across the project are closely
interlinked. Will perform changes in coala, coala-bears,
dependency_management, docker, mobans and coala-utils repository.

## Proposed Approach

### Upgrade dependency_management system 

The dependency_management system provides a Python API for 
familiar package managers. It provides a generic method to
install dependencies in the host operating system. It has 
been a while since it has been upgraded. Change it to support
latest package manager versions.

### Upgrade bears

The problems and procedure associated with upgrading bears are:

- Fix bears to support pip version >10.
- Pytest fails with 16 warnings, eight errors on pip 21.0.1,
  with total coverage dropping to 42.61%.
- Pytest fails with 7 skipped, 26 warnings, ten errors on 
  Python3.9 with coverage dropping to 22.95%
- Python/pip upgrade breaks bear installation and compilation terminates.
    The list of dependencies with these issues are:
    1. `wrapt`: Current version is unsupported, newer version will be used
     instead.
    2. `typed-ast`: Current version is unsupported, newer version will be used
     instead. Required changes in bears for compatibility.
    3. `aenum`: Current version is deprecated for Python3, newer version will
     be used instead.
    4. `lib2to3yaml`: Current version is deprecated and may not be able to parse
     Python 3.10+. `awpa` can be used as an alternative.
    5. `stevedore`: Current version does not support Python 3.9, newer version
     will be used instead.
    6. `libyaml`: This package is not available in PyPI of Python 3.9. 
    `yaml2` can be used as an alternative.
- There are a number of bears that fail due to such import errors caused by
 Python or pip upgrade. Some of which are:
    1. FormatBear
    2. RLintBear
    3. CPDBearTest
    4. PEP8NotebookBear
- Import setup tools fail. This also is caused because of lack of dependencies. 
- Usage of dash-separated description file will not be supported in future versions,
  update these to underscore names.
- Escape sequence at several places are deprecated(warning) in python 3.9, use raw
  strings to avoid warnings.
- Replace "is" and "is not" by "==" and "!=" to avoid syntax warnings on Python 3.8+.
- Fix invalid syntax error for Python 3.7+:
    
    ```python
    import asyncio

    async def main():
        print('Hello ...')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print('... World!')

    # Python 3.7+
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```


### Upgrade coala

The problems and procedure associated with upgrading coala are:
    
- pytest fails with ten warning and one error on python 3.9,
  with total coverage dropping to 23.28%
- core, language definitions, results and bearlib have a missing
  portions that decreases the overall coverage drastically.
- Replace "is" and "is not" by "==" and "!=" to avoid syntax
  warnings on Python 3.8+.
- Fix invalid syntax error for Python 3.7+:
    
    ```python 
    import asyncio

    async def main():
        print('Hello ...')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print('... World!')

    # Python 3.7+
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

### Add GitHub Actions

GitHub actions will be added as an alternative CI.
This will be performed in two steps
    
1. Write configurations for GitHub Actions pipeline.
    Basic working structure for this is as follows:

- sentinel workflow 
    
    ```yaml
    name: sentinel

    on: [push]

    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
        env:
        BEARS_ZIP_URL: https://codeload.github.com/coala/coala-bears/zip
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Setup Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
            python-version: '3.6.9'
        - name: Setup JDK
            uses: AdoptOpenJDK/install-jdk@v1
            with:
            version: '8'
        - name: before_install
            run: |
            pip install --prefer-binary cffi lxml
            pip uninstall setuptools --yes
            pip install pip==9.0.3 setuptools==21.2.2
            python .misc/check_setuptools.py
            cp requirements.txt requirements.orig
            cat test-requirements.txt docs-requirements.txt >> requirements.txt
            sed -i.bak '/^-r/d' requirements.txt
            npm install --no-save
            sudo npm i -g csslint
        - name: install
            run: |
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        - name: before_script
            run: |
            mv requirements.orig requirements.txt
            python .misc/check_setuptools.py
            sed -i.bak '/^-r/d' requirements.txt
        - name: script
            run: |
            py.test
            python setup.py bdist_wheel
            pip install ./dist/*.whl
            curl -fsSL -o coala-bears.zip $BEARS_ZIP_URL/master
            pip install coala-bears.zip[alldeps]
            coala --non-interactive
            python setup.py docs
            .ci/check_man.sh
        - name: after_script
            run: codecov
            ```

- moban workflow
    
    ```yaml
    name: Moban Sync

    on: [push]

    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Setup Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
            python-version: '3.6'
        - name: Install Dependencies
            run: pip install moban~=0.5.0 gitfs2 pypifs
        - name: script
            run: |
            moban
            git diff --exit-code
    ```

2. Add moban template for this new pipeline.

### Remove Circle CI and AppVeyor CI

Circle CI and AppVeyor were used to ensure Windows and MacOS support,
these were also maintained as a fallback if any of the CI solution gets
paid alternatively other can be used. But now with Virtual Machines we
don't have to ensure Windows and Mac Support, also we now have GitHub
actions which is available free of cost.

### Update Docker Image

Fix docker image to serve latest version of coala and bears.
