coala Community Code of Conduct
-------------------------------

Like the technical community as a whole, the coala team and community is made
up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world,
working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and
connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors,
contributors, and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all
of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the coala project. This
includes Gitter, GitHub, Gitlab, the issue tracker, coala events, and any other
forums created by the coala team which the community uses for communication.
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's
ability to participate within them.

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
  to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
  immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex,
  sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,
  political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
  and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
  making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might
  not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
  a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
  feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the
  coala community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well
  as with people outside the coala community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
  Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other
  exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited
  to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information ("doxxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
  then stop.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time and coala is no exception. It is important
  that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
  that we’re different. The strength of coala comes from its varied community,
  people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
  perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
  viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human
  to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on
  helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

# Questions?

If you have questions, feel free to contact us by emailing `community AT

Reporting a Code of Conduct Violation
-------------------------------------

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report
it by creating an issue at https://gitlab.com/coala-coc/coc-issues, and check
the "This issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with
at least Reporter access." checkbox.  We strive to keep all issues confidential.

In your report please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
  If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g.
  a gitter or IRC log) please include a link.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

# What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from a member coala Code of Conduct Commitee
acknowledging receipt immediately.  We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24
hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The coala Code of Conduct Committee will immediately meet to review the
incident and determine:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Who the bad actor was.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety.
* If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
  safety, the coala Code of Conduct comittee's immediate priority will be to
  protect everyone involved.  This means we may delay an "official" response
  until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically
  safe.

Once the coala Code of Conduct Committee has a complete account of the events
they will make a decision as to how to response.  Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
* Giving a warning to the individual(s) involved, either privately or publicly.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from coala spaces).
* A permanent or temporary ban from all of coala spaces (gitter, GitHub, GitLab, etc)
* A request for a public or private apology.
* We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either
  a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking.   We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't
guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, the coala Code of Conduct Committee will make a report on the situation
to coala Community Team Leader.

# Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest, or when the incident involves one of
coala Code of Conduct Committee, the member must immediately notify the other
members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
