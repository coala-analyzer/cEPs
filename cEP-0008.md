# Abstract

Code Review at coala is done using GitHub pull requests. There is no feature to
know the state of a review comment. This cEP aims at forming a standard review
system so that new reviewers can get an idea of existing review comments and
their states.

# Proposed Change

To solve this problem I propose, we use the comment reactions:
1. :+1: for **acknowledged/addressed**.
2. :-1: for **invalid/dropped review comments**
3. :confused: for **under discussion**.

Both reviewer and author have to react to the main/top-level comment on the
given thread as a status report. A pull request will not be merged until all the
review comments are acknowledged by both the reviewer and the author.
