## Abstract

This cEP describes how a gamification system will automate the process
of becoming a `Developer` from a `Newcomer`, as a part of this
[GSoC project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5892040252981248).

For the implementation of this process, we will incorporate a gamification
system which will allow us to track newcomer's progress and assign some
points to each of the activity they do. We will also have different levels
and give them badges on the basis of points earned and performed activities
by the newcomers.

So, every newcomer at coala will have to complete the processes involved in
the gamification system in order to become a developer at coala or to get the
**coala Developer** badge.

## Background

### Newcomer Experience

**The problems we have:**

- How to attract more newcomers
  - How to cope with the increasing amounts of newcomers
- How to teach and help newcomers to learn faster so
  we can keep working on coala at a high pace.
- How to improve newcomer -> dev/maintainer ratio
- How to increase amount of feedback we get
  - How to use feedback to improve coala and processes

## Why Gamification?

As coala tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, it gives them
clear pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is
already known that newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute
to the open source community for the first time. Some barriers they face include
orientation issues that can potentially demotivate newcomers from placing
their first contribution. On the other hand, gamification is widely used to
engage and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve their performance.
Therefore, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and
motivate newcomers to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage
with coala and its community.

## Gamification Elements

There will be three game design elements to help newcomers: Points, Levels
and Badges. For each of these elements, we will have a set of rules to
describe the operation of the gamified environment. i.e.:

### Points and Rules

Let’s start by defining some rules for earning points. Points are a
simple tool to reward behavior, and they provide an excellent base upon which to
build a gamified design. The first step is to define the activities that we want
newcomers to take. i.e.:

- Created Issues by a Newcomer
- Created Pull Requests by a Newcomer
- Number of Gitmate errors on the PR
- CI status of the PR
- Number of reviews done by a Newcomer
- Number of comments in one review by a Newcomer
- Comments on the Issues by a Newcomer
- Activities on Gitter channels
- Introduce `.coafile` in other projects

Then we will assign some points to each of the activity a newcomer perform.
E.g.: If a user is creating a difficulty/newcomer issue he will be awarded
with `10` points, similarly, the value of the points will be increased
according to the difficulty level of the issue.

### Levels

To increase a player’s competitive instinct, we can implement a series of
levels that confer rank as newcomers become more active. A good and
straightforward way to award levels in a new gamified design is to base them
on point thresholds. As players earn points, they move up an incremental
series of levels. To infuse the level with meaning i.e.: a ranking within the
system, the levels should be named in a way that indicates status.

- Level-I:
  - Name: Beginner
  - Points_required = 50
- Level-II:
  - Name: Intermideate
  - Points_required = 150
- Level-III:
  - Name: High
  - Points_required = 300

More complex designs, such as awarding levels based on consecutive activities
are also possible. E.g.:

- Level-I:
  - Joining our Gitter channel and the community
  - Running CI tools on your fork
  - Running coala-ci on a popular GitHub repo
- Level-II:
  - Getting assigned to a difficulty/newcomer issue
  - Creating and merging PR for that issue
  - Reviewing at least one difficulty/newcomer issue
- Level-III:
  - Getting assigned to a difficulty/low issue
  - Creating and merging a PR for that issue
  - Reviewing at least one difficulty/low issue

But that would be hard to implement and out of the scope of this project
as we can't automatically prevent newcomers from performing the activities
which comes under upcoming levels.

### Badges

Another way of explicitly nudging a newcomer to action is to award badges for
completing tasks. Badges enable newcomers to follow their performance and compare
to other newcomers.
Badges will be awarded after performing certain activities by the newcomers:

- Badge-I:
  - Name: The bug finder
  - Details: The one who find bugs in the existing codebase
  - Activities: Created at least 2 or more issues which has a label bug
- Badge-II:
  - Name: The reviewer
  - Details: The one who review others pull requests
  - Activities: Reviewed at least 4 or more PRs
- Badge-III:
  - Name: The coder
  - Details: The one who code
  - Activity: Merged at least 3 or more PRs
- Badge-IV:
  - Name: The coala Developer
  - Details: The ones who are in the coala developers team
  - Activities:
    - Introduce `.coafile` in other projects
    - Merge a difficulty/newcomer Pull Request
    - Review at least a difficulty/newcomer Pull Request
    - Merge a difficulty/low Pull Request
    - Review at least a difficulty/low or higher Pull Request

So, for becoming a developer at coala, a newcomer must complete all the
activities mentioned in the `coala Developer` badge. But in case

This project only focus on coala newcomers team but in future, this system can
also, be extended for developers.

## Implementation

### Getting the data

#### GitHub/GitLab

For getting the data related to newcomers activity on GitHub/GitLab to the
community, we will use [IGitt](https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt),
and since, our community repo is based on Django, we will use
[igitt-django](https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/igitt-django) to do the
initial setup of IGitt with Django. We will first implement `igitt-django` in
the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) and then import the useful
data to the community repo with the use of our APIs.

#### Gitter

For getting the stats of newcomer's messages, we will use
[Gitter API](https://developer.gitter.im/docs/messages-resource) and import
all the messages to newcomers or by newcomers in our webservices with some
textual analysis for avoiding spam. And then we will import the final analysis
of the messages to our community repo for tracking and gamification process.

We will have different Django models for each category like for GitHub/GitLab
data we will have models named `PullRequest`, `Issue`, `Comment` and for Gitter
data we will have models named `GoodMessage`, `BadMessage` and each of these
models will be connected to a `User` model which will help us to track the
activity of each user.

### Tracking Activities

After we have the data, we need to track important activities mentioned in
the above section

We will have a dashboard showing the tracked metrics of the user progress
which will motivate newcomers to work faster to compete with others.

#### Code Implementation

Assuming that we are using
[django-trackstats](https://github.com/pennersr/django-trackstats) for tracking
the statistics of newcomers, then we will make different domains of similar set
of metrics like for activities related to pull requests, we will have a domain
named PullRequest. i.e:

```python
from trackstats.models import Domain
Domain.objects.PullRequest = Domain.objects.register(
    ref='pullrequest',
    name='pullrequest')
```

And then we will define defferent metrics to track in each of the domain:

```python
Metric.objects.PULL_REQUEST_COUNT = Metric.objects.register(
    domain=Domain.objects.PullRequest,
    ref='pull_request_count',
    name='Number of pull requests opened by the user')
```

Now we can store these metrics for the time period we want:

```python
from trackstats.models import StatisticByDate, Domain, Metric, Period
n = Order.objects.all().count()
StatisticByDate.objects.record(
    metric=Metric.objects.PULL_REQUEST_COUNT,
    value=n,
    Period=Period.LIFETIME)
```

### Gamification

As we have already discuss the game elements involved in the gamification
system, we will assign some points to each of the activities we will be
tracking for a newcomer and then accordingly we will unlock the levels and
provide them badges.

#### Assign points to GitHub/GitLab activities

For assigning points to GitHub/GitLab activities the main factor of decision
will be the difficulty level of the issues.

E.g.: If a newcomer has created a difficulty/newcomer issue we will give
him `10` points, similarly we will increase `10` points according to the
increase in difficulty levels.

Similar concepts will be applied to the pull requests but we will also
consider the number of Gitmate errors on the PR which will help us in finding
that if the user has run coala locally before pushing his/her changes.

For activities related to the comments, we will also check if the newcomer
has made the review comment or the issue comment or its a simple comment on
the PR.

But this may lead to failure when the newcomers started doing comments just
for the sake of earning points, to avoid this type of spam we will use some
of the ideas from **Meta-review system**, i.e.: We will also check the reactions
on the comments and if it is Thumbs Down we will not give any points to the
newcomers.

#### Assign points to Gitter activities

It is obvious that tracking “No. of Gitter messages” and giving points for
that will promote un-necessary spamming in the channel. So, to avoid that we
can apply some extra rules on Gitter messages, we will divide our message model
into two parts:

- Good behavior message model
- Bad behavior message model

So, before importing Gitter messages to our models we can check in which
category the message fall? We can do that by applying
[basic sentiment analysis](http://fjavieralba.com/basic-sentiment-analysis-with-python.html)
on the messages.

Basically, we will define two dictionaries of good and bad messages.
In the bad one, we will keep patterns like “please review [issue link]”,
“updated [issue link]”, “have a look [issue link]”, “[mention][issue link]”
etc. So, that a newcomer doesn’t beg for review all the time.
In the good one, we will have the pattern of questions so we will generally
match “?” in the end. But what happens if a newcomer started asking irrelevant
questions? So for that, we can also define a rule like a newcomer can only ask a
certain number of questions in a day. Then we will track both the message model
of the newcomer and assign some points to both separately and see which model
metric has grown fast or slow while the whole newcomer process and not promote
them until they have learned to learn things by themselves.

#### Implementation

Now assuming the implementation of this process with
[django-gamification](https://github.com/mattjegan/django-gamification)
package, first we need to link our `user` model to the gamification interface:

```python
from .models import User
from django.db import models
from django_gamification.models import GamificationInterface

class UserModel(models.User):
    interface = models.ForeignKey(GamificationInterface)
```

Then we can create our first level:

```python
from django_gamification.models import UnlockableDefinition

UnlockableDefinition.objects.create(
    name='Beginner',
    description='You’re a beginner at coala',
    points_required=50
)
```

Similarly, we can create badges and award the user accordingly:

```python
from django_gamification.models import BadgeDefinition, Category

BadgeDefinition.objects.create(
    name='Developer',
    description='You’re now developer at coala',
    points=300,
    progression_target=100,
    category=Category.objects.create(name='Developer Badges',
    description='This is the best bagde'),
)
```

```python
from django_gamification.models import Badge

badge = Badge.objects.first()
badge.award()
```

## Conclusion

This project covers most of the problems a newcomer/maintainer at coala face
during the newcomer->developer process:

- A maintainer will don't have to check manually if the newcomer
  has done all the activities involved in newcomer->developer process,
  he/she can just look at the points and badges earned by the newcomer
  through the gamification system.

- This project provides a fun way to work in the community, newcomers
  will be motivated to work when they will earn points and badges for
  even the tiniest bit of their contributions.

- Having a gamification system will be a good resource to attract more
  newcomers and the automation process could easily deal with an increase
  in the number of new contributors.

- In case if a newcomer is not able to complete the newcomer process
  he/she can get other available badges based on their activities in
  the community, which will be a kind of symbol of their talent and
  work experience.
